Before doing anything, first replace `gym/envs/box2d/lunar_lander.py` with the provided `lunar_lander.py` file.

The only files that you need to look at are `dqn.py` and `train_ac_f18.py`, which you will implement.

See the [HW3 PDF](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/static/homeworks/hw3.pdf) for further instructions.

The starter code was based on an implementation of Q-learning for Atari generously provided by Szymon Sidor from OpenAI.
